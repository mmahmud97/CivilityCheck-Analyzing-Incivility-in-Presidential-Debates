# CivilityCheck-Analyzing-Incivility-in-Presidential-Debates
CivilityCheck is an NLP model that assesses the civility of statements in presidential debates. It labels sentences as "Civil" or "Uncivil" and categorizes uncivil statements by type (e.g., "insult," "personal attack"). CivilityCheck provides insights into tone and discourse trends in high-stakes political dialogue.
